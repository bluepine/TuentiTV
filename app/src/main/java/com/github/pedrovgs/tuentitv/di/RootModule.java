/**
 * Main Dagger module created to provide every dependency with an application scope and Application
 * context. This module is  going to be used to include other modules with application scope and
 * provide some Android common dependencies.
 * <p/>
 * This module injects every Activity/Fragment of this project because we are going to use activity
 * graphs just to support a Navigator implementation described in this talk:
 * http://www.slideshare.net/PedroVicenteGmezSnch/effective-android-ui-english
 * <p/>
 * Presenter implementations are injected over the activity graph without any provisioning method
 * and that's why we don't need to inject Activities and Fragments in activity scope modules.
